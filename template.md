### Introduction
A short description of what the feature is. Try to keep it to a single-paragraph "elevator pitch" so the reader understands what problem this proposal is addressing.

### Motivation
Describe the use cases and problems that this proposal seeks to address. The focus should be on why this feature is valuable to users or what pain point you are looking to address.

### Proposed solution
Describe your solution to the problem. Provide examples and describe how they work. Show how your solution is better than current workarounds: is it cleaner, safer, or more efficient?

### Detailed design
Describe the design of the solution in detail. If it involves new or modified APIs, show the full API and its documentation comments detailing what it does. The detail in this section should be sufficient for someone who is not one of the authors to be able to reasonably implement the feature.
